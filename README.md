# Potentiometer-Analysis
A potentiometer is a type of resistor used to control voltage and current, allowing for ADJUSTABLE settings in devices like volume and lighting! Though it is a bit odd looking, the grey tool at the top is what controls it all. By alternatiing the "switch", it sets the value at a different number which can then be transmitted into code.
A potentiometer works by sliding a contact-called the wiper- across a resitor. As the wiper moves, it changes the ratio of resitance between the terminals, while also adjusting the output voltage. This makes potentiometers perfect for things like tuning sensors, controlling brightness, or creating interactive uputs in robots/mechanisms.
